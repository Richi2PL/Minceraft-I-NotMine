Here are a few reasons that it might not work:
- Your browser doesn't support [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5), at this point there is no valid excuses...
- Your browser doesn't support [WebGL 2.0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
- Your browser doesn't support [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API)
- Your browser doesn't support [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)

Try using the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Opera, or Safari to see if it will work, if it doesn't it might be a driver glitch so just open an issue.
